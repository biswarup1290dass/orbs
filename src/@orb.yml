  > !! Forked version of Scribe Security's original CCI Orb.
  Scribe offers CircleCI Orbs for embedding evidence collecting and integrity verification to your workflows.
  The Orb provides several actions enabling generation of SBOMs from various sources.
  The usage examples on this page demonstrate several use cases of SBOM collection (SBOM from a publicly available Docker image, SBOM from a Git repository,
  SBOM from a local directory) as well as several use cases of uploading the evidence either to the Circle CI workspace or to the Scribe Service.
