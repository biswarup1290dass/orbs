  Following is a example utilizing OCI registry as a evidence store.

  Each storer can be used to store, find and download evidence,
  unifying all the supply chain evidence into a system is an important part to be able to query any subset for policy validation.

  Use `setup_remote_docker` step (Optional) to allow access to a local docker daemon.
  Otherwise image targets is read directly from remote registry.

usage:
  version: 2.1
  orbs:
    scribe: scribe-security/orbs@x.y.z

  workflows:
    scribe-service-job:
      jobs:
        - checkout
        - setup_remote_docker # Optional
        - scribe/install
        - scribe/bom:
            target: busybox:latest
            format: statement
            verbose: 2
            oci: true
            oci-repo: $OCI_REPO
        - scribe/verify:
            target: busybox:latest
            input-format: statement
            verbose: 2
            scribe-enable: true
            oci: true
            oci-repo: $OCI_REPO
